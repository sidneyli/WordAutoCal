# WordAutoCal

WordAutoCal is an VSTO addin for word 2013 and 2016. It is triggered by the selection change event. 

When the selection contains a range of cells within the word application, it will calculate the summation of all numerical content and show it in the status bar. Just like the auto summation feature for ealier word versions and excel.
